# Code of Conduct

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

In positive terms, this means:

1. Try to understand what hurts others and avoid these things.
2. Try to understand what helps others and aim to do those things.
3. Take these actions while trying to understand the others as a whole while
   being aware of how individuals may vary from that norm.

In negative terms, this means:

1. Do not wait for others to follow the code of conduct first, but take
   initiative and let the others follow your example.
2. When others mistreat you or deal poorly according to this code of conduct, do
   not return that behavior in kind.

All in all, show grace to others when they are in the wrong and be meek in
return. Do all things well and to the benefit of all. Be excellent and seek to
be perfect and yet do not allow being perfect get in the way of being good.
